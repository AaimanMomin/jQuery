        <p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

            The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
            
            jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
            
            jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
